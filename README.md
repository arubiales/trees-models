# Models based in trees
### Summary of the repository
* This is a repository to learn about the model based in trees, so we are not going to waste time in the cleaning or EDA steps or explain them. Obviously there are better methods to clean the data and to do an EDA
* We are not going to drop correlated variables, this is why I want to show the power of models based in trees to discriminate variables that don't add value to the model


### Files of this repository
